    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Since my degree is in computer programing, I enjoy programming and building websites. I want to create a website
      that offers easy access to ordering flowers from a local flower shop. No matter where you’re at, whether you’re at
      the office or sitting in rush hour traffic. Think of the last time you bought flowers. Did you go to a flower
      shop, or did you stop at the store? I bet you stopped at the store. That’s where my website would give you the
      chance to have fresh flowers for your loved ones with just a click of a button. </p> <!-- change this -->


    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>The target audience include families, couples, and single people. Whether they are in need of wedding or funeral
      flowers. Flowers for an anniversary or birthday. A big dance is coming up or maybe even just some last-minute
      flowers for that date. The website is there to help people that either don’t want to bother going to the flower
      shop or maybe they just don’t have time. With the website being accessible from your computer at work, your laptop
      at home or your mobile devices while sitting in traffic they can have access to fresh flower form anywhere. </p>

Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->
