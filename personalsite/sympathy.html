            It's never an easy when you lose a loved one, but a funeral should be celebration of life. There for the
            flowers should be an extension in every aspect. From the casket mount to the easel even down to the smallest
            container. If you have any special items like, their favorite sport, a hobby, maybe even something forms
            their career. Any of these ideas can be incorporated into the arrangements. There are also options for
            smaller arrangements that are great options to send directly to the family to help brighten up there day
            during this difficult time. If there is something specific, you would like to say to the family we are happy
            to add it to the card. Other wise we will add something appropriate to the card.
