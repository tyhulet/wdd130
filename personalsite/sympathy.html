                It's never an easy when you lose a loved one, but a funeral should be celebration of life. There for the
                flowers should be an extension in every aspect. From the casket mount to the easel even down to the
                smallest
                container. If you have any special items like, their favorite sport, a hobby, maybe even something forms
                their career. Any of these ideas can be incorporated into the arrangements. There are also options for
                smaller arrangements that are great options to send directly to the family to help brighten up there day
                during this difficult time. If there is something specific, you would like to say to the family we are
                happy
                to add it to the card. Other wise we will add something appropriate to the card.

                Being in sick is never a fun experience. That's where our flowers come into play, because whether there
                in the
                hospital because of a broken bone or something more serious. Or just at home because of the flu or
                covid-19, there
                day can still be brightened up with some flowers. Options include simple tasteful wraps, small
                arrangements, large
                arrangements. Some even including a stuffed animal so they can have a companion while they are sick.
                When it comes
                to get well arrangements the cards that are included. The costumer would provide what is on the card.
                But we also
                offer the option to add something simple if you don't provide something for the card.
